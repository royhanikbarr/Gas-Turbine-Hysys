# Gas-Turbine-Hysys
Simulation of Gas Turbine Power Plant in Aspen Hysys

### Description
![Simulation Picture](https://github.com/royhanikbarr/Gas-Turbine-Hysys/blob/main/simulation%20of%20gas%20turbine.PNG)

Basically there are two type of cycles in Gas Turbine simulation 
1. Open loop
2. Closed Loop

In my simulation, open loop is more effective to generate power

So, I want to optimize the power generation with heat exchanger

The increase of adding the heat exchanger is 11.53%

It's so fun to learn gas turbine cycle, especially in simulation of hysys

I hope you enjoy, thank you
